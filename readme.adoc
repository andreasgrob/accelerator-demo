= CloudBees Build Acceleration Demo

== Demo: Building with emake

. Insert a free `+gcp-project-id+` in `+environment.yaml+` and possibly change the folder under which the project will be created.
. Create a `+license.txt+` file, containing an Accelerator license.
  ** You will receive a 30 day license a few minutes after https://www.cloudbees.com/products/build-acceleration/trial[signing up for a trial].
. Run `+./run.sh+`. This will:
  ** Create the project
  ** Setup networking
  ** Provision the VMs
  ** Install Accelerator on the VMs
  ** Run a demo of building cmake with emake

From here you can try your own builds or modify this script to your needs. Keep in mind to install dependencies on both VMs: emake-machine and agents. After installing on the agents VM, you need to restart it.

To ssh into one of the three VMs (agents, emake-machine, cluster-manager) you can use `+./ssh.sh <machine name>+`

== ToDo

* Explore the UI
* Test cloud bursting
